# Task-05: Neural Style Transfer 🎨🧠

This project was developed as part of the **Prodigy Infotech GenAI Internship**, focusing on **Neural Style Transfer** — blending the content of one image with the artistic style of another using a pre-trained deep learning model.

---

## 📌 Objective
To apply the artistic style of a reference image (e.g., a painting) onto a content image (e.g., a photograph) using **deep neural networks** based on **VGG19** and **Gram matrix** style representations.

---

## 📚 Concepts Used
- Transfer Learning with **VGG19**
- Feature Extraction for Style & Content
- **Gram Matrix** calculation for style representation
- Weighted style/content loss
- **Total Variation Loss** for smoothness
- TensorFlow eager execution

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, PIL, NumPy

---

## 📂 Dataset / Input

- **Content Image**: Labrador Retriever
- **Style Image**: Kandinsky's *Composition 7*
- Downloaded directly using TensorFlow utility

---

## 🔍 Implementation Highlights

✅ **Image Preprocessing** with dynamic resizing
✅ **VGG19 Layer Selection** for style & content extraction:
  - Style: 5 layers from early-to-deep
  - Content: Final convolution layer of block5
✅ **Custom Gram Matrix** function
✅ **Trainable Tensor** initialized from content image
✅ **Loss Function** combining:
  - Style Loss (Gram matrix)
  - Content Loss (feature comparison)
  - Total Variation Loss (smoothness)
✅ **Training Loop** with progress every few epochs
✅ **Multiple modes**:
  - Quick Transfer (5 epochs)
  - High-Quality Transfer (15 epochs)
  - Custom Transfer (10 epochs by default)

## 🖼️ Output Example

Below is the output generated by applying **Kandinsky's painting style** on a photo of a **Labrador Retriever**:

```
Original Content     |     Style Reference     |     Stylized Result     |     Side-by-side Comparison

```

---

## 📈 Results

- Style elements like brushstrokes and color palette are transferred to the content image
- Output improves over time due to dynamic optimization
- Smooth blending enabled by total variation regularization

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python neural_style_transfer.py
```

Or use any of the following functions for custom configuration:
```python
fast_style_transfer(content_path, style_path)
high_quality_style_transfer(content_path, style_path)
```
